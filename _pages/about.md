I am Mahdi, a fifth-year Bachelor's student in Computer Engineering at Sharif University of Technology.

Throughout my studies, I have conducted research and projects in Optimization, Natural Language Processing, Medical Image Analysis, and other intriguing topics. However, my main focus has always been Trustworthy AI. Nowadays, with the rapid growth of deep learning models, concerns regarding these models have been brought to attention. There are many questions to explore: Are the models robust against adversaries? Do they preserve data privacy? What about being fair? And many other questions. As of now, I am working to find solutions to these questions.
